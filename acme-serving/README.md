# Overview

This module represents the work of deployment engineers, who maintain model serving APIs 
and related infrastructure

# Running

## Creating a Model

The data scientists have provided code in `acme-datasci` that constructs a model. Here,
that code is run on a cluster in order to create a final model. This model is then exported
as an MLeap bundle for deployment.

Check out this code on a cluster edge node or other location that can build this code
and then run it on the cluster. Run `mvn package` at the top level to create a runnable 
Spark application.

From this module root directory, run:

```bash
spark2-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode client target/acme-serving-1.0.0.jar
```

This should update the model in `src/main/resources/model.zip`. This updated model could
be checked in via `git` then. This offers a basic strategy for model versioning.

## Testing the model

Because the `model.zip` file is versioned with the project, it can be used in automated
tests that are executed by a continuous integration system like 
[https://travis-ci.org/](https://travis-ci.org/). This means that the resulting model can
be verified automatically.

It can also be tested locally with simply `mvn test` at the top level.

## Deploying the Model

Given an Mleap bundle for the model, it's easy to deploy it as a REST API with
the [mleap-serving module](https://github.com/combust/mleap/tree/master/mleap-serving).
Start the compiled mleap server binary in the background:

```bash
tar -xzf bin/mleap-serving-0.7.0.tgz
mleap-serving-0.7.0/bin/mleap-serving
```

Load the current model using `curl` and the JSON API:

```bash
curl -XPUT -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{"path":"src/main/resources/model.zip"}' \
 http://localhost:65327/model
```

Try scoring an instance:

```bash
  curl -XPOST -H "accept: application/json" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{
    "schema": {
      "fields": [{
        "name": "Temperature",
        "type": "double"
      }, {
        "name": "Humidity",
        "type": "double"
      }, {
        "name": "Light",
        "type": "double"
      }, {
        "name": "CO2",
        "type": "double"
      }, {
        "name": "HumidityRatio",
        "type": "double"
      }]
    },
    "rows": [[20.89, 27, 14.0, 1427, 0.004122]]
  }' http://localhost:65327/transform
```

The output gives a probability for "0" (not occupied) and "1" (occupied). You can see that
the model believes it's about 95% likely that this room is unoccupied.
