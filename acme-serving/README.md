# Overview

This module represents the work of deployment engineers, who maintain model serving APIs 
and related infrastructure

# Running

## Creating a Model

The data scientists have provided code in `acme-datasci` that constructs a model. Here,
that code is run on a cluster in order to create a final model. This model is then exported
as PMML for deployment.

Check out this code on a cluster edge node or other location that can build this code
and then run it on the cluster. Run `mvn package` at the top level to create a runnable 
Spark application.

From this module root directory, run:

```bash
spark2-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode client target/acme-serving-1.0.0.jar
```

This should update the model in `src/main/models/model.pmml`. This updated model could
be checked in via `git` then. This offers a basic strategy for model versioning.

## Testing the model

Because the `model.pmml` file is versioned with the project, it can be used in automated
tests that are executed by a continuous integration system like 
[https://travis-ci.org/](https://travis-ci.org/). This means that the resulting model can
be verified automatically.

It can also be tested locally with simply `mvn test` at the top level.

## Deploying the Model

Given a PMML description of the model, it's easy to deploy it as a REST API with
[OpenScoring](https://github.com/openscoring/openscoring). 
Start the compiled openscoring server binary:

```bash
java -jar bin/server-executable-*.jar
```

Load the current model:

```bash
java -cp bin/client-executable-*.jar org.openscoring.client.Deployer \
  --model http://localhost:8080/openscoring/model/OccupancyDetection \
  --file src/main/resources/model.pmml
```

Try scoring an instance:

```bash
java -cp bin/client-executable-*.jar org.openscoring.client.Evaluator \
  --model http://localhost:8080/openscoring/model/OccupancyDetection \
  -XTemperature=20.89 \
  -XHumidity=27 \
  -XLight=14 \
  -XCO2=1427 \
  -XHumidityRatio=0.00412229841538944
```

The output gives a probability for "0" (not occupied) and "1" (occupied). You can see that
the model believes it's about 15% likely that this room is occupied.
